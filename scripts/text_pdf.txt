Introduction to Algorithms: 6.006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professors Erik Demaine and Srini Devadas September 8, 2011 Problem Set 1 Problem Set 1 Both theory and programming questions are due Thursday, September 15 at 11:59PM. Please download the .zip archive for this problem set, and refer to the README.txt ﬁle for instructions on preparing your solutions. Remember, your goal is to communicate. Full credit will be given only to a correct solution which is described clearly. Convoluted and obtuse descriptions might receive low marks, even when they are correct. Also, aim for concise solutions, as it will save you time spent on write-ups, and also help you conceptualize the key idea of the problem. We will provide the solutions to the problem set 10 hours after the problem set is due, which you will use to ﬁnd any errors in the proof that you submitted. You will need to submit a critique of your solutions by Tuesday, September 20th, 11:59PM. Your grade will be based on both your solutions and your critique of the solutions. Problem 1-1.
